## Overview
* The purpose of this analysis was to compare temperature data during the month of June with the month of December, including mean, standard deviation, min, and max.

## Results:

1. The mean temperature for June was 74.944 degrees, vs a mean temp of 71.042 degrees for December. June was 5.2% warmer than December, on average.
2. The minimum temperature for June was 64 degrees, vs a minimum temp of 56 degrees for December. The minimum temperature in June was 12.5% warmer than December's minimum.
3. The max temperature for June was 85 degrees, vs a max temp of 83 degrees for December. The max temperature in June was 2.35% warmer than December's max.

## Summary
* As would be expected for a location in the northern hemisphere, the temperatures are generally warmer in the summer months like June, vs the winter months like December. Overall, the weather in Hawaii is quite tropical, with very little relative temperature change across the seasons. 8 degree difference between min temperature in December vs June is relatively small compared with other states in the USA.

## Additional Analysis Suggestion
* Another interesting analysis would be a comparison of precipication between the months. This would be another important factor if one were to plan outdoor activities in Hawaii.
* Relative humidity would be an interesting comparison as well.
